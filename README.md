# Course System Project

## Overview

The Course System Project is divided into two main modules: `core` and `infra`. The `core` module contains the main application logic, while the `infra` module provides the necessary infrastructure to run the application locally and in a production environment.

## Modules

### Core Module

The `core` module contains the primary application code for the Course System. It includes all business logic, APIs, and other core functionalities.

For detailed information on how to start and use the core module, please refer to the [core module README](core/README.md).

### Infra Module

The `infra` module provides the infrastructure necessary to run the application. It includes configurations for Docker, Docker Compose, and database setups.

For detailed instructions on setting up the local development environment and other infrastructure-related tasks, please refer to the [infra module README](infra/README.md).
