# Course System Core

## How to Start the Project

To start the project locally, please review the README file from the *infra* module.

## First Steps

After the application has started, follow these steps:

1. Call the `/api/v1/authenticate` endpoint with the predefined data (according to the requirements, the application always starts with the specified administrator).
2. Receive the Bearer token and use it in all subsequent API calls.

Next, you can create several new users and assign them roles from the following list: [STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR, ADMIN]. This will enable you to create courses, fill in all the required information, and perform all basic Course System actions.
